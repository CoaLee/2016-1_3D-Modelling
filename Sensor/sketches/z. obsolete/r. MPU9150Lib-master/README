MPU9150Lib is an implementation of 9-axis data fusion on an Arduino using the InvenSense MPU-9150 IMU. See MPU9150Lib.pdf for details.

Added Accel9150 to demonstrate how to calculate residual accelerations in the body frame.

Added magMix parameter to MPU6150Lib::init(). This controls how much influence the magnetometer has on the yaw information:
  
  0 = Just use MPU-9150 gyros and ignore the magnetometer
  1 = Just use magnetometer and ignore gyro yaw information
  2-n = Fuse gyro and magnetometer information. The higher the value, the less influence the magnetometer has.

The value that's best will depend on the application and the environment. See MPU9150Lib.h for more.
